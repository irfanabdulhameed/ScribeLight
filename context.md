<!-- ### **ScribeLight: AI-Powered YouTube Video Chat Tool**  

#### **Project Description**  

ScribeLight is an innovative AI-powered web application that enhances the way users interact with YouTube videos. Instead of watching an entire video to extract relevant information, users can input a YouTube link, and ScribeLight transcribes the spoken content. The transcribed text is then processed using **Gemini AI**, allowing users to **ask questions, get summaries, and highlight important parts of the conversation**â€”all within a **ChatGPT-like interface**.  

Built with **React.js for the frontend** and **Flask for the backend**, ScribeLight ensures a seamless and efficient user experience. While most pages remain static, the **Summarize Page** dynamically processes transcriptions and AI-generated responses.

### **How ScribeLight Works**  

1. **User Input** â€“ The user enters a YouTube video link into the application.  
2. **Video Transcription** â€“ The system extracts and converts the spoken content into text using **YouTube API** or **youtube-dl**.  
3. **AI Processing** â€“ The transcribed text is sent to **Gemini AI**, which enables intelligent responses.  
4. **Interactive Chat Interface** â€“ Users can ask questions about the videoâ€™s content, just like in ChatGPT.  
5. **Enhanced Navigation & Highlighting**  
   - ðŸ”´ **Text Highlighting** â€“ Users can highlight important text in red for better readability.  
   - ðŸ—º **Minimap Feature** â€“ A **VSCode-like minimap** provides an overview of the chat, enabling **quick navigation** within the conversation.
